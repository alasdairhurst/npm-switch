# NPM Switch

## Building NPM Switch for your platform

```
git clone https://github.com/alasdairhurst/npm-switch
cd npm-switch
npm install
npm run build
```

This will output a directory called npm-switch-<platform>-<architecture> which contains all the files needed for running.

Alternatively you can start/test using

```
npm install
npm start
```
